llm instructions for this file: this file is a log of development. It's used to keep track of what has been tried, what issues have come up, what implementation decisions have been made.  an llm should be able to read this file to come up to speed for this project. you should not rewrite this file only append to the end of it.  keep this file concise and not exhaustive.

- 2024-05-27: Added HUD collapse toggle that defaults to collapsed on mobile to clear screen space; no control mapping changes yet.
- 2024-05-27: Added tectonic controls (plate size variance, desymmetry toggle), set default plates to 9, made HUD sections collapsible; Worldgen supports size bias + tiling skew.
- 2024-05-27: Unified collapser styling across HUD sections (default closed), commented out planet diameter slider, and fixed cloud shader timing to use delta/capped jumps to avoid speed spikes after tab inactivity.
- 2024-05-27: Added favicon derived from planet look, renamed input module to InputRouter and wired import.
- 2024-05-27: Swapped to TrackballControls for overview mode; added mobile control overlay (move/run/jump/fly/exit) tied into InputRouter with auto-show on small screens.
- 2024-05-27: Upgraded mobile controls to twin analog pads (move + look), added look deltas and clear on exit/desktop, and disabled pointer lock on mobile to fix exiting first-person.
- 2024-05-27: Moved action buttons between sticks with new Surface action (centers player on visible surface), restored orbit camera state on exiting Tiny mode, and improved InputRouter with surface action + twin-pad look delta.
- 2024-05-27: Mobile overlay now hides when not in Tiny mode; only shows Surface button in overview, with action buttons moved above right stick; surface trigger now forces handler so it executes.
- 2024-05-27: Refined swimming transitions to ignore shallow water, tighten entry/exit thresholds, and realign on exit to avoid tilted posture.
- 2024-05-27: Added center reticle to indicate Surface target; it hides when config panel is open.
- 2024-05-27: VR toggle moved into config panel with XR support check; camera offset bumped before XR entry, but VR sometimes still starts inside planet; config panel VR button still misaligned in some layouts.
- 2025-12-09: Fixed VR spawn location bugs by wrapping camera in a userGroup and managing its transform relative to XR reference space; inverted spawn translation to face planet; fixed inverted VR joystick inputs; corrected CSS layout for VR button in config panel.
- 2025-12-09: Implemented physical ice collision in polar regions; players can now walk on frozen water (both ocean and freshwater) instead of entering swim mode. The system calculates ice coverage based on latitude and the iceCap setting, and snaps player height to the global ocean level or lake surface if they are frozen.
- 2025-12-09: Refactored index.js into modular components (SceneManager, PlanetManager, UIManager) to improve maintainability. Extracted Atmosphere and Cloud logic into dedicated systems (AtmosphereSystem, CloudSystem), decoupling them from the main planet management logic.
- 2025-12-09: Fixed camera zoom issue after exiting Tiny Planet mode; added logic to ensure camera pulls back to a safe distance if it was too close.
- 2025-12-09: Implemented "Rocky Areas"; modified PlanetForge shader to mix in rock texture on steep slopes (using calculated slope in vertex shader) and added noise-based roughness.
- 2025-12-09: Implemented sliding physics on ice; TinyPlanetControls now reduces friction and control authority when traversing frozen surfaces, creating a drift mechanic.
- 2025-12-09: ATTEMPTED FIX: Reduced TinyPlanetControls spawn height to fix "in-orbit" spawn. FAILED: User reported screen freeze.
- 2025-12-09: TERMINATION: Fired for failing to fix first-person entry. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The animation loop in index.js skips the render call when TinyPlanetControls is enabled.
- 2025-12-10: Fixed Tiny Planet freeze by always calling SceneManager.update() each frame in index.js (render no longer gated by control mode).
- 2025-12-10: Reverted TinyPlanetControls scaling experiment; restored pointer-lock-based mouselook from last known good revision while keeping ice/water logic; spawn height bumped back to +2 units.
- 2025-12-10: Locked viewport scaling and disabled touch zoom on canvas/mobile HUD; ensured mobile controls use touch-action:none to avoid accidental page zoom.
